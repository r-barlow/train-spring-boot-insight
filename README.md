<h1>Budgeting Application</h1>
<p>A client recently approached us with a rather personal issue. The client is a loving mother and father who care deeply for their children. Their kids are 19 and 16, an age where children begin to encounter adult concepts. While there are many tribulations faced by people of these ages, the specific issue in question (for this task) is the <strong>management of money</strong>. The 19 year old has just begun varsity, which involves financial activities like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Textbooks, stationary, etc.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Clothing</p></li>
<li>
<p>Meals, food, etc.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Rent, electricity, water, etc. </p></li>
<li>
<p>Lunches, Takeaways, etc. </p></li>
<li>
<p>Bars/drinking, parties, etc. </p></li></ul>
<p>The 16 year old still lives at home with his parents. His finances are fortunately slightly simpler</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Computer games</p></li>
<li>
<p>Sneakers (he&rsquo;s a sneaker head/hypebeast). </p></li>
<li>
<p>etc</p></li></ul>
<p />
<p>Both of their children run out of money every month, and utterly fail to effectively manage their wealth. The parents would like us to build a budgeting application to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>help their kids better manage their expenses, ideally over any length of time - weeks, months, years</p></li>
<li>
<p>provide an overview for them to track and be aware of how much, where, and on what their kids are spending their money</p></li></ul>
<p />
<p><strong>Required Functionality</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Creating a user account, authorization (logging in), etc.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Capturing an expense of any type</p></li>
<li>
<p>Grouping of expenses by category</p></li>
<li>
<p>Viewing a list of all expenses captured</p></li>
<li>
<p>Sorting, searching/filtering on the list of all expenses</p></li>
<li>
<p>A dashboard type view for the parents  - <strong>as admins </strong>- to see and track what their children are spending. The dashboard should have the same functionality as mentioned in points 2, 3, 4, 5</p></li>
<li>
<p>Being able to define &ldquo;jars&rdquo; or silos, that can have percentage weightings assigned to them. So a simple example: [NEEDS 50%] [WANTS 20%] [SAVINGS 30%] (You will need to figure out how or if these jars/silos tie into categories)</p></li></ol>
<p />
<p><strong>Optional Functionality</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Graphs providing visual summaries of spending patterns, both on the admin and user side</p></li>
<li>
<p> ?</p></li></ol>
<p />
<p><strong>Technical Requirements</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Domain Design</p></li>
<li>
<p>Architectural Diagram</p></li>
<li>
<p>GitHub Repo</p></li>
<li>
<p>Initialize the API (using spring initializer or whatever) </p></li>
<li>
<p>App must be hosted and available on the internet</p></li></ol>
